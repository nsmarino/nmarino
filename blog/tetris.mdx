I used [p5js](https://p5js.org/) to create a simple Tetris clone and practice the basic concepts of [object oriented programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/). I first became aware of p5js from the Coding Train videos produced by [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/), who also wrote the excellent book [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/), which I would recommend to anyone interested in simulating natural systems or making art with code.

The completed game can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/nsmarino/sketches/6KxrcCVIp).

## Basic Setup
The p5js library is basically a set of utilities wrapped around the HTML5 Canvas. At its most straightforward, it consists of two functions: a setup() function that runs once on page load, and a draw() function that loops over and over until you tell it to stop.

After staring at a jpeg of a tetris game for a while, I figured I should start by setting up a grid for the pieces (which i will refer to as 'tetrominos' for this rest of this post) to move around on.

```javascript
// Sketch.js:
const tileCount = 10
let tileSize

function setup() { // This runs once
  createCanvas(200, 400);
  tileSize=width/tileCount 
  // each square of the grid will be 20px by 20px
}

function draw() { // This will loop
  background(50); 
}
```
## Creating the Tetrominos
I began by making a simple tetromino of a random shape that falls from the top of the screen and comes to rest at the bottom of the screen. I created a new file, 'Tetromino.js', and placed it in my index.html before the sketch.js file so that the sketch.js file has access to it.

There are [seven basic Tetromino shapes](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetromino?file=Tetromino_image.png). We can represent them as JavaScript objects, each with a color and an array of strings that each depict a possible position the tetromino can be in.

I created a Tetromino [constructor function](https://javascript.info/constructor-new) for creating tetromino objects. Here we can define the properties that each tetromino has (such as shape, color, and position) and the actions it can take (such as rotating and moving). Once this function is written, we can use it in our sketch.js function to make tetrominos.

Because each tetromino is made of four blocks, I alse created a Block constructor function. The idea is that the Tetromino will serve as a 'manager' for the four blocks that it contains. Each action taken by the Tetromino will update the properties of the blocks that form it.

```javascript
// Tetromino.js:

const types = // ...Array of types info...
const randomType = () => types[Math.floor(random(types.length))]

function Tetromino(type=randomType()) {
  this.active = true
  this.type = type
  this.origin = {x: 0, y: 0}
  this.rotateStep = 0

  // get shape from type and create four blocks
  this.setBlocks = function(shape = type.shapes[0]) {
  const blocks = []
  let pos = {x: this.origin.x, y: this.origin.y}
  for (let i=0; i<shape.length; i++) {
    if (shape[i]===`x`) { // BLOCK
      blocks.push(new Block(pos.x,pos.y,this.type.color))
      pos.x = pos.x + tileSize
    } else if (shape[i]===`-`) { // LINEBREAK
        pos.y = pos.y + tileSize  
        pos.x = this.origin.x
    } else if (shape[i]===`.`) { // SPACE
      pos.x = pos.x + tileSize
    }  
  }
  return blocks
  
  }
  this.blocks = this.setBlocks()

  // call the display function of each
  // of the four blocks
  this.display = function() {
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      block.display()
    }
  }
}

// Called four times by Tetromino function
function Block(x,y,color) {
  this.x = x
  this.y = y
  this.color = color
  
  this.display = function() {
    fill(this.color)
    square(this.x,this.y,tileSize)
  }
}

```
Let's update the sketch.js file to display our tetromino.

```javascript
// Sketch.js:
const tileCount = 10
let tileSize

// define tetromino globally so setup()
// and draw() both have access to it
let tetromino

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 400);
  tileSize=width/tileCount 
  // use new keyword to create instance of Tetromino
  tetromino = new Tetromino() 
}

function draw() {
  background(50);

  // Call display function of tetromino, which
  // calls display function for each of its blocks.
  tetromino.display()
}
```
Each time we run our sketch, we get a random tetromino in the upper left corner.

## Making the Tetromino Fall
The default framerate of p5js is 60 frames per second, which means that the draw() function fires 60 times every second. Let's update the tetromino's position every 15 seconds. Again, the tetromino will serve as a manager for the blocks that form it. 

I try to name my functions and variables as clearly as possible, so you can read the code like a sentence. If tetromino CAN go down...go down!

```javascript
// Tetromino.js:

function Tetromino(type=randomType()) {
  // ... rest of tetromino code ...

  // Checks position of each block by calling
  // block's downIsBlocked() function
  this.canGoDown = function() {
    let downIsClear = true
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      if (block.downIsBlocked()) downIsClear = false
    }
    return downIsClear
  }

  // Updates the position of each block with 
  // block's goDown() function
  this.goDown = function() {
    this.origin.y = this.origin.y + tileSize
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      block.goDown()
    }
  }
  
  // Checks position of tetromino and updates it
  // at regular intervals determined by global
  // variable 'speed' in sketch.js
  this.update = function() {
    if (frameCount%speed===0) {
      if (this.canGoDown()) {
        this.goDown()
      }
    }
  }
}

function Block(x,y,color) {
  // ... rest of Block code ...

  this.downIsBlocked = function() {
    let downIsBlocked = false
    // Checks if block is at bottom of screen.
    if (this.y+tileSize === height) downIsBlocked = true
    return downIsBlocked
  }

  this.goDown = function() {
    this.y = this.y + tileSize
  }
}
```
The following lines can be added to sketch.js:

```javascript
// Sketch.js:

const tileCount = 10
let tileSize
// highlight-next-line
let speed = 15

let tetromino

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 400);
  tileSize=width/tileCount 
  tetromino = new Tetromino() 
}

function draw() {
  background(50);

  tetromino.display()
  // highlight-next-line
  tetromino.update()
}
```

When we run our sketch, our tetromino will spawn in the upper-left corner and move downward every 15 frames until it comes to rest on the bottom of the screen.

<img src='/blog/tetris/dropping-tetromino.gif' alt="dropping tetromino" />

## Piling Up Tetrominos
Each time our tetromino reaches the ground, we want a new tetromino to appear at the top of the screen. That tetromino will drop down until it reaches the previous tetromino and come to rest on top of it.

### Handling tetrominos at rest
Once a tetromino has reached the ground, all we need to know about it is its color and location. Let's stop thinking about it as a tetromino and deal with it as a bunch of static blocks. In sketch.js, we can create an array to hold the information of these blocks, then render them to the screen in the draw() function.

```javascript
// Sketch.js:

let filledTiles = []
// ...other global vars...

function setup() {
  // ...
}

function draw() {
  // ...

  for (const tile of filledTiles) {
    push()
    fill(tile.color)
    square(tile.x,tile.y,tileSize)
    pop()
  }
}
```

We can add tile info to this array every time a tetromino comes to rest on the ground.

```javascript
// Tetromino.js:

// ...

  this.update = function() {
    if (frameCount%speed===0) {
      if (this.canGoDown()) {
        this.goDown()
        // highlight-start
      } else {
        // Once the tetromino hits the ground, it will
        // no longer be considered 'active.'
        this.active = false
        for (const block of this.blocks) {
          filledTiles.push(
            {x: block.x, y: block.y, color: this.type.color}
            )
        }
      }
      // highlight-end
    }
  }
```

With our tetromino, now inactive, we can create a new one.

```javascript 
// Sketch.js:

function draw() {
  if (!tetromino.active) {
    tetromino = new Tetromino()
  }
  // ...
}
```

<img src="/blog/tetris/piling-up.gif" alt="piling up!" />

## Handling Collisions
As can be seen above, our tetrominos are dropping one by one, but aren't yet aware of each other. Let's add the ability for the active tetromino's blocks to check their location against our array of filled tiles, so that the tetromino will only drop if the path is clear.

```javascript
// Tetromino.js:

function Block(x,y,color) {
  // ...

  this.downIsBlocked = function() {
    let downIsBlocked = false
    if (this.y+tileSize === height) downIsBlocked = true
    // highlight-next-line
    else if (this.downTileIsFilled()) downIsBlocked = true
    return downIsBlocked
  }
  // Check the block's position against the objects stored
  // in the filledTiles array.
  // highlight-start
  this.downTileIsFilled = function() {
    return filledTiles.some(tile => (
      tile.x === this.x && tile.y === this.y + tileSize
    ))
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```
The tiles now pile up, forming a swaying skyscraper.

Now that we can reach the top of the screen, we might as well make it possible to lose the game.

```javascript

// Sketch.js:

function draw() {
  // ...

  if (filledTiles.some(tile=>tile.y===0)) {
    background('black')
    textSize(16);
    textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
    text('game over', width/2, height/2);
    // Prevent draw() from continuing to loop:
    noLoop()
  }
}
```

## Moving Left and Right
Let's add some code to allow the player to move the active tetromino left and right with the arrow keys:

```javascript
// Sketch.js:

function keyPressed() {
  const activeTet = tetromino

  if(keyCode===LEFT_ARROW) {
    if (activeTet.canGoLeft()) activeTet.goLeft()
  }
  if(keyCode===RIGHT_ARROW) {
    if (activeTet.canGoRight()) activeTet.goRight()
  }
  // Move down faster than once every 15 frames:
  if(keyCode===DOWN_ARROW) {
    if (activeTet.canGoDown()) activeTet.goDown()
  }
}
```

It is often helpful to write out the logic you want before actually writing the necessary functions. That said, let's now dip into Tetromino.js and give our tetromino the ability to go right and left. Just like when moving down, we will first check if the path is clear for the tetromino's four blocks, then move the tetromino if we get the go-ahead.

```javascript
// Tetromino.js:

function Tetromino(type=randomType()) {

  // ...

  this.canGoLeft = function() {
    let leftIsClear = true
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      if (block.leftIsBlocked()) leftIsClear = false
    }
    return leftIsClear  
  }

  this.goLeft = function() {
    this.origin.x = this.origin.x - tileSize
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      block.goLeft()
    }
  }
  
  this.canGoRight = function() {
    let rightIsClear = true
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      if (block.rightIsBlocked()) rightIsClear = false
    }
    return rightIsClear  
  }
  this.goRight = function() {
    this.origin.x = this.origin.x + tileSize
    for (const block of this.blocks) {
      block.goRight()
    }
  }

  // ...
}

function Block(x,y,color) {

  // ...

  this.leftIsBlocked = function() {
    let leftIsBlocked = false
    if (this.x === 0) leftIsBlocked = true
    else if (this.leftTileIsFilled()) leftIsBlocked = true
    return leftIsBlocked
  }
  this.leftTileIsFilled = function() {
    return filledTiles.some(tile => (
      tile.x === this.x - tileSize && tile.y === this.y
    ))
  }

  this.goLeft = function() {
    this.x = this.x - tileSize
  }

  this.goRight = function() {
    this.x = this.x + tileSize
  }
  this.rightIsBlocked = function() {
    let rightIsBlocked = false
    if (this.x + tileSize === width) rightIsBlocked = true
    else if (this.rightTileIsFilled()) rightIsBlocked = true
    return rightIsBlocked
  }

  this.rightTileIsFilled = function() {
    return filledTiles.some(tile => (
      tile.x === this.x + tileSize && tile.y === this.y
    ))
  }

}

```

It is clear this long and repetitive series of functions violates the sacred [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle of programming. However, for now I have decided to leave it as it is, as I find it more readable this way. If I were to add new functionality to the game, it would probably be a good idea to refactor.

## Adding Rotation
Let's use the UP arrow key to rotate the tetromino:

```javascript
// Sketch.js

function keyPressed() {
  // ...
    if(keyCode===UP_ARROW) {
      if (activeTet.canRotate()) activeTet.rotate()
    }
  // ...
}
```
Rotation is actually very simple. We already have access to an array of the four possible orientation each tetromino can have, so we will cycle through them with each keypress as long as there is nothing blocking our way.

```javascript
// Tetromino.js

function Tetromino(type=randomType()) {

  // ...

  this.canRotate = function() {
    // Get the next shape in the array so we can check if it will fit.
    const nextShape = this.setBlocks(
      type.shapes[(this.rotateStep + 1) % this.type.shapes.length]
    )

    let rotateIsClear = true
    
    for (const block of nextShape) {
      // Will return true if the position the block
      // would occupy is already filled.
      const tileIsFilled = filledTiles.some(tile => (
        tile.x === block.x && tile.y === block.y
        )
      )
      // check left border
      if (block.x < 0) rotateIsClear = false
       // check right border
      else if (block.x >= width) rotateIsClear = false
      // check other blocks
      else if (tileIsFilled) rotateIsClear = false
    }
    return rotateIsClear
  }
  
  this.rotate = function() {
    this.rotateStep++
    const indexOfNextShape = this.rotateStep % this.type.shapes.length
    this.blocks = this.setBlocks(type.shapes[indexOfNextShape]) 
  }
}
```

## Deleting Filled Rows
We can now put our tetrominos exactly where we want! However, even our best efforts will eventually result in defeat, as we have not implemented a way to delete filled rows.

<img src="/blog/tetris/neatly-arranged.png" alt="neatly arranged, but no way to delete rows" />

Let's add a function to our sketch that checks if a row has been filled. If the row is full, it will be deleted and all filled tiles above it will move down one space.

```javascript
// Sketch.js:

// Let's add a score that goes up each time a row is deleted.
let score = 0

const checkFilledRows = function() {
  // Loop over each row of the screen:
  for (let i=0;i<(height/tileSize); i++) {
    const row = i*tileSize

    const tilesInRow = filledTiles.filter(tile => tile.y===row)
    
    if (tilesInRow.length === width/tileSize) {
      // Remove row from filledTiles array
      filledTiles = filledTiles.filter(tile => !tilesInRow.includes(tile));
      // Move down any filled tiles that were above deleted row.
      filledTiles.forEach(tile => {
        if(tile.y < row) tile.y = tile.y + tileSize
      })
      score=score+200
    }
  }
}
```

## Finishing touches
Our game of tetris is now fully operational. To make it a little more interesting, let's show the player their score, and increase the speed when they reach certain thresholds.

```javascript
// Sketch.js:

let speed = 15
// highlight-next-line
let level = 1
let score = 0

// ...

function draw() {
  background(50);
  fill('white')
  text(`level ${level}`,0,10)
  text(`score ${score}`,0,30)
  
  if (score>=2000) {
    level=2
    speed=10
  }
  
  if (score>=5000) {
    level=3
    speed=5
  }

  // ...

}
```

<img src="/blog/tetris/completed-game.gif" alt="The game is now complete and can be played." />

### Next steps
It might be nice to add some animations to the blocks when a row is deleted. A big explosion, something like that. Sound effects?

This project might also be a good place to experiment with [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).
