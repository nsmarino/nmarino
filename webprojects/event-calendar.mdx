Event calendar created while I was working at Reed Library in Carmel, NY. Admins can create and modify events, and are able to schedule daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence. Patrons of the library can register for events and receive email confirmation after registering. Visit the site at reedevents.vercel.app, or explore the source code on github.
