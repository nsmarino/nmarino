I created this portfolio site to showcase recent fullstack projects, to keep track of my ideas through regular blogging, and to give myself a home on the World Wide Web. The design is fairly simple but there were a few interesting problems I had to wrestle with.

<Detail sum="Generating pages from MDX">

It was important to me to achieve full separation of concerns when crafting this site. I knew I would spend most of my time writing text content, so I determined the best workflow would be to write all posts as MDX files, then set up templating and static page generation behind the scenes. This way I could:

  - have 2 different templates, one for blog posts and one for web project overviews
  - easily write content as text files, without worrying about translating them into webpages
  - be able to enhance pages with React components on an 'as-needed' basis.

### Using next-mdx-remote

Following this principle of separation of concerns, I keep all of my blog posts in a directory at the project root called 'blog,' and store web project overviews in a directory at the project root called 'webprojects.' In this way, the content is decoupled from the sitebuild; I could easily refactor to store the posts elsewhere. If I were building a similar site for someone else, I would perhaps source the content from a CMS. 

Whether stored locally or in a database or CMS, the next step is to create a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) that will turn each MDX file into a static web page.

To create web project overview pages such as this one, I made a directory at the project root called 'webprojects,' with a single file [id].js inside of it. This bracket syntax indicates to NextJS that we will be creating a dynamic route using two of the tools that NextJS provides for data fetching: the `getStaticPaths` function, which will create a static webpage for each path it receives, and the `getStaticProps` function, which will then populate those static webpages with content. The [next-mdx=remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) library is used to load MDX files.

Here is a simplified version of `./webprojects/[id].js` with presentational code and other irrelevant details removed:

```javascript
// ./webprojects/[id].js:
import renderToString from 'next-mdx-remote/render-to-string'
import hydrate from 'next-mdx-remote/hydrate'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

import { getIdsFromDirectory, getFileContents } from 'utils/fs'

import Layout from '@/components/Layout'
import Detail from '@/components/WebProjectPage/Detail'
import Images from '@/components/WebProjectPage/ProjectImages'
import CodeBlock from '@/components/CodeBlock'

const components = { 
  Detail,
  pre: props => <div {...props} />,
  code: CodeBlock,
}

export default function WebProject ({ source, frontMatter }) {
  const content = hydrate(source, { components })

  return (
    <Layout title={frontMatter.title}>
      <main css={styles}>
      <h1>{frontMatter.title}</h1>
      {content}
      </main>
      <Images images={frontMatter.images} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = getIdsFromDirectory('webprojects')

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const source = await getFileContents('webprojects', params.id)

  const { content, data } = matter(source)

  const mdxSource = await renderToString(content, { components, scope: data })

  return { 
    props: 
    { 
      source: mdxSource, 
      frontMatter: data 
    } 
  }
}
```

First, each file from the 'webprojects' directory is converted to a path in the `getStaticPaths` function, using a utility function:

```javascript
// ./utils/fs.js:
export function getIdsFromDirectory(dir) {

  const directory = path.join(process.cwd(), dir)

  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(directory)
    return fileNames.map(fileName => {
      return {
        params: {
          id: fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, '')
        }
      }
    })
  }
```
Each path returned from this function has an id parameter which can be accessed within `getStaticProps`. First the id is used to get the contents of the mdx file:

```javascript
export async function getFileContents(dir, id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(dir, `${id}.mdx`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
  
  // Combine the data with the id and contentHtml
  return fileContents
}
```
[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) is used to pull out the metadata from the file. It is then prepared for rendering using the `renderToString` function from `next-mdx-remote`. It is important to import any components with the MDX file will be using, and provide them as an argument to next-mdx-remote's `renderToString` and `hydrate` functions so that they can be used in the completed web page. `renderToString` prepares the file on the server side, while `hydrate` is used in the client to initially render static content, then update any dynamic content once the browser has completed all higher-priority tasks.

I found this a very convenient way to work, and was able to quickly create a similar template for longer-form blog posts.

<Detail sum="Self-Updating Table of Contents for MDX blog posts in NextJS">

I wanted to write long, detailed blog posts about different projects I am working on. For the convenience of the reader, I set up a self-updating table of contents that pulls all H2-level headers from the blog posts, written in MDX. I discussed this process in a [blog post](/blog/toc-for-mdx-blog).
